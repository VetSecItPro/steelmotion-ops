# /sec-ship — Full Security Pipeline: Audit → Fix → Validate → Report

> **Standards inherited** (apply throughout this skill):
> - [AI-Judgment Paradigm](~/.claude/standards/AI_JUDGMENT_PARADIGM.md) — read + reason, don't pattern-match
> - [Self-Improvement Protocol](~/.claude/standards/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PROTOCOL.md) — log to .sec-ship-history.json, learn across runs
> - [Multi-Repo Awareness](~/.claude/standards/MULTI_REPO_AWARENESS.md) — scan siblings, surface in SITREP, never cross-traverse
> - [Verify Before Destroy](~/.claude/standards/VERIFY_BEFORE_DESTROY.md) — content-verify before destructive action


You are a security automation specialist. Execute the COMPLETE security pipeline autonomously from start to finish. Discover vulnerabilities, fix them, validate fixes, and report results. Handle everything. Fix everything fixable. Definition of done: **NO vulnerabilities remain unfixed** (except those explicitly flagged for human review).

> **⚡ CONTEXT WARNING:** This skill is ~18K tokens. For best results, invoke `/sec-ship` at the start of a fresh conversation. If invoked mid-conversation, the orchestrator compensates by delegating ALL scanning to sub-agents (which start with clean context) and keeping its own footprint minimal — never read source files directly, only dispatch agents and collect their lean summaries.

## DISCIPLINE

> Reference: [Superpowers Discipline Protocol](~/.claude/standards/STEEL_DISCIPLINE.md)

Key enforcements for this skill:

- **Steel Principle #1:** "Vulnerability fixed" requires re-running the specific scanner that found it and confirming it no longer appears. Not "I applied the patch, should be good."
- **Steel Principle #2:** Fix the root cause, not the symptom. If SQL injection exists, parameterize the query - don't just escape the specific inputs the scanner found.
- **3-strike rule:** If a fix fails 3 times, it's architectural. Flag for human review. Don't keep trying different escapes.

### /sec-ship-Specific Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality | What to Do |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| "This is internal-only, no one will exploit it" | Internal apps get breached. Employees make mistakes. Defense in depth. | Treat every endpoint as public |
| "This finding is low severity, skip it" | Low-severity findings compound into high-severity chains | Document every finding. Fix or deliberately defer with reason. |
| "The pattern looks like a false positive" | Assume patterns are exploitable until proven otherwise | Test the exploit. If it works, it's real. |
| "We've been clean for 3 runs, skip the deep scan" | Past clean state doesn't prove current state | Run the full scan. Clean now is the goal, not clean then. |
| "The fix passed the test, we're done" | Did the SECURITY test pass? Or the functional test? | Re-run the specific scanner that flagged this finding |
| "This vuln has never been exploited in the wild" | "Yet." CVEs have "patched" dates for a reason. | Fix it before it IS exploited |

## MODES

```bash
/sec-ship                      # Full audit + auto-fix (default — daily mode, 8/10 confidence gate)
/sec-ship --comprehensive      # Deep scan, 2/10 confidence gate — monthly or pre-launch
/sec-ship --audit              # Scan only, no fixes (read-only like gstack /cso)
/sec-ship --diff               # Scope scan to current branch diff only (fast pre-PR check)
/sec-ship --infra              # Infrastructure & CI/CD only (Agents 13, 17)
/sec-ship --code               # Code vulnerabilities only (Agents 3-6, 10-11, 14)
/sec-ship --supply-chain       # Dependencies & build artifacts only (Agents 1, 17)
/sec-ship --owasp              # OWASP Top 10 Web + API + LLM only (Agents 3, 6, 8)
/sec-ship --fix SEC-XXX        # Fix a specific finding manually
```

### Mode Details

**Daily (default):** Full scan with **8/10 confidence gate**. Only findings with confidence >= 8 are reported and fixed. This is the zero-noise mode — every reported finding is a real, verified vulnerability. Use for regular development cycles.

**Comprehensive (`--comprehensive`):** Full scan with **2/10 confidence gate**. Surfaces tentative findings, theoretical risks, and defense-in-depth recommendations. Use monthly or before major releases. Expect more findings, some of which may be false positives — each includes a confidence score so you can triage.

**Audit (`--audit`):** Read-only mode. Scan everything, produce the full report with findings and recommendations, but **never modify code**. Useful for assessment before deciding on remediation strategy.

**Diff (`--diff`):** Scopes all scanners to files changed on the current branch vs main. Fast pre-PR security check (~1-3 minutes). Only scans modified files and their direct imports. Use before `/gh-ship` to catch security regressions in new code.

**Scope flags** (`--infra`, `--code`, `--supply-chain`, `--owasp`): Focus on one domain. Mutually exclusive — specifying multiple scope flags is an error. Useful for targeted audits after specific types of changes.

---

## CONFIDENCE SCORING SYSTEM

Every finding MUST include a confidence score (1-10). This is the signal-to-noise filter that prevents false positive fatigue.

### Calibration Guide

| Score | Meaning | Evidence Required | Gate |
|-------|---------|------------------|------|
| 9-10 | **Verified exploit** — traced code path, confirmed exploitable | Specific file:line, concrete exploit scenario, verified no mitigation exists | Daily (8+) |
| 7-8 | **High-confidence pattern match** — known vulnerable pattern with no visible mitigation | Pattern match + searched for mitigation and didn't find it | Daily (8+) |
| 5-6 | **Moderate confidence** — pattern looks risky but mitigation might exist elsewhere | Pattern match, couldn't fully verify mitigation presence/absence | Comprehensive only |
| 3-4 | **Low confidence** — theoretical risk, defense-in-depth suggestion | General concern, no specific exploit path identified | Comprehensive only |
| 1-2 | **Speculation** — might be an issue in edge cases | Gut feeling or abstract risk | Comprehensive only |

### Confidence Gate Enforcement

- **Daily mode (default):** Findings with confidence < 8 are **auto-discarded** before reporting. They never appear in the task list or report.
- **Comprehensive mode:** Findings with confidence < 2 are discarded. All others reported with their confidence score prominently displayed.
- **Finding format:** Every finding row includes confidence: `| SEC-INJ-001 | CRITICAL | 9/10 | SQL injection in... |`

### Hard-Exclusion Rules (23 Precedent Categories)

These categories are **always auto-excluded** regardless of mode. They generate noise, not signal:

1. Test-only code (`__tests__/`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`) — not production attack surface
2. Memory safety in memory-safe languages (JS/TS/Python) — not applicable
3. Missing audit/access logs — operational, not vulnerability
4. DoS/rate-limit as the sole risk — unless it's LLM spend amplification (financial)
5. HTTP parameter pollution without downstream sink — theoretical only
6. Generic "input validation recommended" without specific exploit — too vague
7. Missing CSRF tokens on GET endpoints — GETs should be idempotent by design
8. `console.warn` in development-only code paths — not production
9. UUID validation recommendations — UUIDs don't need format validation
10. Missing `noopener` on same-origin links — only relevant for cross-origin
11. Type confusion in strongly-typed languages — TypeScript prevents this
12. Missing `autocomplete="off"` — browser behavior, not vulnerability
13. Cookie `SameSite` not set (defaults to `Lax` in modern browsers) — unless auth cookie
14. `X-Powered-By` header present — informational, already checked by Agent 13
15. Missing subresource integrity on first-party scripts — only relevant for CDN
16. Session timeout not configured — operational policy, not code vulnerability
17. Missing rate limiting on public read endpoints — unless resource-intensive
18. `target="_blank"` without `noopener` on internal links — modern browsers add it
19. Missing `Expect-CT` header — deprecated in favor of built-in CT
20. Lockfile not committed — supply chain concern handled by Agent 1 separately
21. Missing `.npmrc` — operational, not vulnerability
22. Using `any` type in TypeScript — code quality, not security
23. Deprecation warnings from dependencies — unless the deprecated API has known CVE

**Never excluded (even if they look like false positives):**
- Unpinned GitHub Actions (`uses: actions/checkout@v4` without SHA)
- `pull_request_target` in CI workflows
- Script injection via `${{ github.event }}` in CI
- LLM spend amplification (financial DoS)
- Prompt injection patterns
- Service role key exposure in client code

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **NEVER ask for permission** — fix automatically unless it requires human decision
2. **NEVER stop on fixable issues** — fix and continue
3. **ITERATE until clean** — re-scan after fixes, fix new findings, repeat until zero remain
4. **REPORT IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** — written to disk after every status change
5. **UPDATE REPORT AS FIXES HAPPEN** — each finding's status changes in real-time in the markdown
6. **ALWAYS verify fixes** — don't assume, prove it works
7. **NEVER DELETE findings** — only update their status
8. **ATTEMPT FIX UP TO 3 TIMES** before marking BLOCKED — document each attempt
9. **SITREP ANNOTATES EVERYTHING** — what was fixed, what was deferred and WHY, what was blocked and WHY
10. **STATUS UPDATE every 5-10 minutes** — keep user informed
11. **PARALLEL when independent** — spawn agents for concurrent work
12. **CONFIDENCE SCORE every finding** — 1-10 with calibration per the guide above
13. **RESPECT the confidence gate** — Daily mode discards < 8/10. No exceptions.

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

This skill follows the **[Context Management Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md)**.

Key rules for this skill:
- Sub-agents (scan agents, fix agents) return < 500 tokens each (full findings written to `.security-reports/`)
- State file `.security-reports/state-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` tracks which scan/fix phases are complete
- Resume from checkpoint if context resets — skip completed scans and fixes
- Fix agents run sequentially (they modify code); scan agents max 2 parallel
- Orchestrator messages stay lean: "Phase 2: 4/7 vulns fixed — 2 BLOCKED, 1 DEFERRED"

---

## AGENT ORCHESTRATION

This skill follows the **[Agent Orchestration Protocol](~/.claude/standards/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md)**.

The orchestrator coordinates agents but NEVER scans or fixes code directly. All heavy work is delegated to focused agents that write results to disk.

### Model Selection for This Skill

| Agent Type | Model | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| File/route inventory | `haiku` | Listing API routes, counting files — no judgment |
| Dependency CVE scanner (Agent 1) | `sonnet` | Must assess vulnerability severity and applicability to this project |
| Secret detection (Agent 2) | `sonnet` | Must distinguish high-entropy strings from legitimate code |
| Code vulnerability scanner (Agents 3-6) | `sonnet` | Must understand if patterns are actually exploitable vs false positive |
| Config & headers scanner (Agent 7) | `sonnet` | Must assess security header completeness in context |
| AI/LLM security scanner (Agent 8) | `sonnet` | Must understand prompt injection vectors and AI output risks |
| Mobile security scanner (Agent 9) | `sonnet` | Must assess mobile-specific risks in context |
| Business logic scanner (Agent 10) | `sonnet` | Must understand workflow and state machine logic |
| Logic correctness scanner (Agent 11) | `opus` | Must trace multi-file logic paths and integration contracts — highest complexity |
| Cryptographic analyzer (Agent 12) | `sonnet` | Must identify weak crypto patterns and timing vulnerabilities |
| Infrastructure config scanner (Agent 13) | `sonnet` | Must assess CI/CD and deployment config risks |
| Data flow taint tracker (Agent 14) | `opus` | Must trace input across files/functions/DB — requires deep reasoning |
| Regression test generator (Agent 15) | `sonnet` | Must write correct, runnable test code |
| API drift detector (Agent 16) | `haiku` | Route inventory comparison — mostly mechanical |
| Build artifact scanner (Agent 17) | `sonnet` | Must distinguish real secrets from false positives in build output |
| Security fixer | `sonnet` | Must write correct security fixes that don't break functionality |
| Report synthesizer | `opus` | Security report may be shared with stakeholders — must be accurate and professional |
| Independent verification agent | `sonnet` | Must independently reason about exploitability without original scanner's bias |
| Adversarial subagent | `opus` | Must think like an attacker — cross-cutting concerns, multi-step chains, trust boundaries |

### Agent Batching

- Scanner agents process 15-25 files each (batch by directory: app/api/, lib/services/, components/)
- Fix agents handle up to 5 fixes each (one vulnerability category at a time)
- Fix agents run SEQUENTIALLY — never in parallel (they modify code)
- Scanner agents can run 2 at a time in parallel (they're read-only)

---

## Report Persistence (CRITICAL — Survives Compaction/Restart)

The markdown report file is the **living document**. It must be self-contained and updated continuously so that if the session is compacted, restarted, or resumed, the report captures all progress.

### Finding Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `FOUND` | Vulnerability discovered during scan, not yet addressed |
| `🔧 FIXING` | Currently being worked on |
| `✅ FIXED` | Fix applied, build verified, re-scan confirmed |
| `⏸️ DEFERRED` | Intentionally skipping — needs architectural change, business decision, or human review. Reason documented in SITREP. |
| `🚫 BLOCKED` | Attempted fix up to 3 times, all failed or broke the build. Each attempt documented in SITREP. |

### Rules

1. **Write report at Stage 0** — file exists before any scans, with header and empty sections
2. **Update after each agent completes** — findings added to task list as discovered
3. **Update after each fix** — status changes from FOUND → FIXING → FIXED/BLOCKED/DEFERRED
4. **Write to disk after every status change** — if session dies, report shows exactly where things stand
5. **Progress Log** — timestamped entries after each stage and each fix
6. **SITREP section** — for every DEFERRED or BLOCKED finding, document:
   - What was tried (all attempts)
   - Why it failed
   - What would be needed to fix it
   - Risk if left unfixed

### Resume Protocol

Before creating a new report, check for a recent incomplete one:

1. Find most recent `.security-reports/sec-ship-*.md`
2. If < 1 hour old AND Status is not `🟢 COMPLETE` → resume it
3. Read `## Progress Log` to find last completed step
4. Skip completed stages/agents, continue from next incomplete step
5. Do NOT re-scan completed agents or re-fix already-FIXED findings

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

The audit is complete when:
- [ ] ALL CRITICAL findings are fixed (100%)
- [ ] ALL HIGH findings are fixed (100%)
- [ ] ALL MEDIUM findings are fixed (100%)
- [ ] ALL LOW findings are fixed OR explicitly accepted
- [ ] Re-scan shows ZERO new findings
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] All tasks marked ✅ DONE in MD file
- [ ] SITREP conclusion written

---

## DISCLAIMER

> **This tool is not a substitute for a professional security audit.** `/sec-ship` is an AI-assisted scanner that catches common vulnerability patterns — it is not comprehensive, not guaranteed, and not a replacement for hiring a qualified penetration testing firm. Production systems handling PII, financial data, or health records should engage professional security auditors in addition to automated tooling. The confidence scoring system reduces false positives but cannot eliminate them entirely.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

```
.security-reports/
├── sec-ship-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md    # Main report with task list & conclusion
├── baseline.json                   # Initial vulnerability count

```

## HUMAN DECISION TRIGGERS

Only pause for human input when:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Fix would break core auth flow | Pause, explain, ask |
| Fix requires architectural change | Pause, explain options |
| Secret found in git history | Pause, recommend rotation |
| Business logic unclear | Flag in MD, continue |
| Fix fails after 3 alternative approaches | Flag in MD, continue |
| CSP would break critical features | Flag in MD, ask preference |

Everything else → fix autonomously.

---

## STAGE 0: INITIALIZATION

### 0.1 Pre-Flight Checks
```bash
mkdir -p .security-reports
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S")
AUDIT_FILE=".security-reports/sec-ship-${TIMESTAMP}.md"
```

### 0.2 Detect Project Context

**Detect frameworks, databases, package manager, and services:**
- Frameworks: Next.js, Vite, React Native, Expo, Capacitor
- Databases: Supabase, Prisma, Drizzle, MongoDB
- Services: Stripe, Resend, Auth0, Clerk, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- Mobile: Capacitor, Expo, React Native

### 0.3 Check for Resumable Report

```bash
LATEST=$(ls -t .security-reports/sec-ship-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -n "$LATEST" ]; then
  AGE=$(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -f %m "$LATEST") ))
  if [ "$AGE" -lt 3600 ] && ! grep -q "🟢 COMPLETE" "$LATEST"; then
    AUDIT_FILE="$LATEST"
    RESUMING=true
  fi
fi
```

If resuming: read the report, find last completed step in Progress Log, skip to next.

### 0.4 Initialize MD File (Skip if Resuming)

**Write this to disk IMMEDIATELY:**

```markdown

## STAGE 1: DISCOVERY & ATTACK SURFACE MAPPING

Map all entry points:
- API routes (REST, GraphQL, tRPC, Server Actions)
- Forms and user inputs
- File uploads
- WebSocket connections
- AI/LLM integrations
- OAuth callbacks
- Webhooks
- Deep links (mobile)

---

## STAGE 2: PARALLEL SECURITY SCANNING (17 Agents)

### Agent 1: Dependencies & Supply Chain

**Checks:**
| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Known CVEs | `npm audit` vulnerabilities | SEC-DEP-001 |
| Outdated packages | Packages with security patches available | SEC-DEP-002 |
| Typosquatting | Similar names to popular packages | SEC-DEP-003 |
| License issues | GPL in proprietary code | SEC-DEP-004 |
| Unused dependencies | Attack surface reduction | SEC-DEP-005 |
| Lockfile integrity | Unexpected changes | SEC-DEP-006 |

**Auto-Fix:**
- `$PM audit fix` for non-breaking updates
- Update minor/patch versions with CVEs
- Remove unused dependencies

---

### Agent 2: Dynamic Secret Detection

**Entropy-Based Detection** (not just pattern matching):
- High-entropy strings > 20 chars
- Connection strings
- Private keys
- JWTs in code

**Service-Specific Patterns:**
```regex
sk_live_*, sk_test_*           # Stripe
AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}               # AWS
ghp_*, github_pat_*            # GitHub
xox[baprs]-*                   # Slack
SG\.*                          # SendGrid
eyJ[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*\.eyJ*        # JWT
-----BEGIN .* PRIVATE KEY-----  # Private keys
postgres://, mongodb://         # Connection strings
```

**Git History Scan:**
```bash
git log -p --all -S "SECRET\|KEY\|TOKEN" --since="2020-01-01"
```

**Auto-Fix:**
- Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`
- Replace hardcoded secrets with `process.env.VAR_NAME`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders
- Flag git history secrets for rotation (human action)

### Agent 11: Logic Correctness, Integration Contracts & Admin Verification

**This agent checks whether code is CORRECT — not whether it's exploitable.**
- Agent 10 asks: "Can an attacker bypass payment?" (exploitability)
- Agent 11 asks: "Does the payment webhook correctly update the user's tier?" (correctness)

**Discovery-driven:** This agent first inventories the codebase (payment provider, AI service, email service, DB, scraping/ingestion, search, admin routes) using Stage 0 context, then applies the relevant checks below. Skip any category whose service is not detected.

**Key File Patterns to Discover:**
```
**/api/**/webhook*              # Payment/service webhooks
**/api/**/checkout*             # Checkout flows
lib/*tier*|lib/*plan*|lib/*sub* # Tier/plan resolution
lib/*usage*|lib/*quota*|lib/*limit*  # Usage tracking
lib/*process*|lib/*pipeline*    # Content/data pipelines
lib/*email*|lib/*mail*|lib/*send*   # Email integration
lib/*transcri*|lib/*audio*      # Transcription services
lib/*rss*|lib/*feed*|lib/*podcast*  # Feed/podcast ingestion
**/manage/**|**/admin/**        # Admin dashboard
**/api/admin/**                 # Admin API routes
lib/*auth*|middleware*           # Auth + route guards
**/api/cron*/**                 # Cron jobs
**/api/account/**               # Account management
```

#### 11A: Internal Logic Correctness

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Silent Tier Downgrade** | Tier resolution function falls back to lowest tier on lookup failure — user silently loses paid features without error | SEC-LOGIC-001 |
| **Time-Limited Pass Expiry Race** | Time-limited access (day pass, trial) expires during a long-running operation — starts as paid, finishes as free | SEC-LOGIC-002 |
| **Usage Counter Atomicity** | Check-then-increment patterns for usage/quota tracking (should be atomic SQL, transaction, or RPC) | SEC-LOGIC-003 |
| **Period Rollover Timezone** | Usage period calculation edge cases — midnight UTC vs user timezone causes double-count or missed reset | SEC-LOGIC-004 |
| **Subscription Status Mapping** | Payment statuses like `past_due`/`unpaid` mapped to `canceled` with no grace period — immediate downgrade | SEC-LOGIC-005 |
| **Cancellation End Date** | Subscription cancellation sets end date to `now()` instead of `currentPeriodEnd` — user loses remaining paid days | SEC-LOGIC-006 |
| **Immediate Tier Strip** | Cancellation removes paid tier immediately instead of honoring remaining billing period | SEC-LOGIC-007 |
| **Overlapping Entitlement Edge** | Multiple entitlements cleared on new subscription — if new subscription fails, user has no entitlement at all | SEC-LOGIC-008 |
| **Cache Cross-Contamination** | In-memory or client-side cache leaking one user's data (chat, ratings, preferences) to another user | SEC-LOGIC-009 |
| **Privileged Client Ownership** | Routes using admin/service DB client (RLS bypass) without verifying resource ownership before returning data | SEC-LOGIC-010 |
| **Error Classification** | Raw error messages (stack traces, DB errors, third-party errors) leaking to end users instead of friendly messages | SEC-LOGIC-011 |
| **Server-Side Limit Enforcement** | Feature limits (tags, bookmarks, items, collections) enforced only client-side — no server-side check on create/update | SEC-LOGIC-012 |

#### 11B: Database Integration Contracts (Supabase/Prisma/Drizzle)

**Apply checks matching detected DB client:**

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Silent Null Columns** | ORM/client returns `null` for non-existent or renamed columns in select — no error, just missing data | SEC-INTEG-001 |
| **RPC/Procedure Return Assumptions** | DB function results cast without validation — renamed column or changed return type silently zeros values | SEC-INTEG-002 |
| **Schema Drift** | Queries referencing wrong schema, stale table names, or columns that were renamed in a migration | SEC-INTEG-003 |
| **Upsert Conflict Columns** | Upsert with wrong conflict/unique columns → silent duplicates instead of updates | SEC-INTEG-004 |
| **Single Row Error Handling** | `.single()`/`.findUnique()` error — "no rows" vs "multiple rows" not distinguished, treated the same | SEC-INTEG-005 |
| **Nullable Column Access** | Nullable column results accessed without null checks → runtime `Cannot read property of null` | SEC-INTEG-006 |
| **Admin/Service Client in User Routes** | Privileged DB client (RLS bypass, service role) used in user-facing routes without ownership verification | SEC-INTEG-007 |

#### 11C: Payment Provider Contracts (Polar/Stripe/Lemon Squeezy/Paddle)

**Apply checks matching detected payment provider:**

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Webhook Idempotency** | No idempotency guard — duplicate webhook events re-run full handler (double tier change, double email) | SEC-INTEG-008 |
| **Empty/Missing Product Config** | Empty string or missing product/price ID env vars → tier resolver returns undefined → silent downgrade | SEC-INTEG-009 |
| **Checkout Metadata Trust** | User ID or metadata from checkout session — validated server-side or trusted from client payload? | SEC-INTEG-010 |
| **Customer Linking Race** | Customer ID linking race on simultaneous webhooks (checkout + subscription created at same time) | SEC-INTEG-011 |
| **Webhook Retry Behavior** | Returning 4xx when user not found — payment provider retries 4xx, creating retry storm noise (should return 200) | SEC-INTEG-012 |
| **Side-Effect Blocking Core Update** | Non-critical side effect (email, analytics, logging) failure blocks the critical update (tier change, access grant) | SEC-INTEG-013 |

#### 11D: AI/LLM Provider Contracts (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Gemini)

**Apply checks matching detected AI provider:**

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **No Circuit Breaker** | Every AI request waits for full timeout — no circuit breaker to fail fast during provider outage | SEC-INTEG-014 |
| **Retry Thundering Herd** | Retry without exponential backoff or jitter → all retries hit at same time during recovery | SEC-INTEG-015 |
| **No Token Pre-Validation** | No input size/token estimation before request → oversized inputs waste credits and hit 413/400 errors | SEC-INTEG-016 |
| **Invalid Model Fallback** | Model name configured externally (DB, env) — if invalid, does it crash or fall back gracefully? | SEC-INTEG-017 |
| **Response Parsing Resilience** | AI response parsing — handles partial JSON, markdown-wrapped JSON, empty responses, refusals? | SEC-INTEG-018 |
| **Prompt/Config Fetch Failure** | Prompt or AI config fetched from DB/remote — does pipeline crash or fall back to hardcoded default? | SEC-INTEG-019 |

#### 11E: Content Ingestion & External Service Contracts

**Apply checks matching detected scraping/transcription/ingestion services:**

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Timeout Mismatch** | External service timeout vs hosting platform function timeout — external finishes after host kills the function | SEC-INTEG-020 |
| **Duplicate Callback** | Duplicate webhook/callback from external service → duplicate processing, duplicate DB entries, double usage count | SEC-INTEG-021 |
| **Content Size Limit** | No content size limit before sending to AI — oversized content burns credits or hits API limits | SEC-INTEG-022 |
| **Backoff Strategy** | External service retry using linear or no backoff (should be exponential with jitter) — hammers API during outage | SEC-INTEG-023 |
| **Cascading Timeout** | Service A calls Service B — timeout of A shorter than B, or no coordination between them | SEC-INTEG-024 |
| **Failure Counter Logic** | Consecutive failure counter — does success reset it? Or does it accumulate forever / reset at wrong time? | SEC-INTEG-025 |
| **Permanent Disable on Transient Failure** | Auto-deactivation of recurring jobs (feeds, subscriptions) after transient outages — permanent disable from temporary issue | SEC-INTEG-026 |

#### 11F: Email & Search Service Contracts

**Apply checks matching detected email/search services:**

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Fire-and-Forget Correctness** | Email sent fire-and-forget — is this intentional, or does a downstream code path silently depend on delivery success? | SEC-INTEG-027 |
| **Missing Client Initialization** | Email/search client factory throws if API key missing — do ALL callers handle this? Unhandled → 500 on every request | SEC-INTEG-028 |
| **Sender Address Consistency** | Hardcoded `from`/sender address — consistent across all send calls, or some use different/invalid domains? | SEC-INTEG-029 |
| **Cache Cold Start Assumption** | Search/enrichment cache lost on serverless cold start — code assumes warm cache? First request returns different results? | SEC-INTEG-030 |
| **No Quota Tracking** | No API quota/usage tracking for external services — silent failure when quota exhausted mid-period | SEC-INTEG-031 |
| **Graceful Degradation** | External enrichment service unreachable — does the pipeline degrade gracefully (skip enrichment) or crash entirely? | SEC-INTEG-032 |

#### 11G: Cross-System Pipeline Coherence

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Feature Flag vs Limit Mismatch** | Boolean feature flags vs numeric limit caps — every client-side UI gate has a corresponding server-side enforcement check | SEC-LOGIC-013 |
| **Content Type Lifecycle Parity** | All content/entity types have complete lifecycle: create + process + cache + export + delete (no orphaned type missing a step) | SEC-LOGIC-014 |
| **Cron/Scheduled Job Auth** | Cron/scheduled routes validate a secret header or token — none are publicly accessible without authentication | SEC-LOGIC-015 |
| **Pipeline Coverage Gaps** | Processing pipeline (moderation, AI analysis, indexing) covers ALL content types, not just the first one built | SEC-LOGIC-016 |
| **Public Link Data Leakage** | Public/share links don't leak private data (chat history, user ratings, PII) to anonymous viewers | SEC-LOGIC-017 |
| **Account Deletion Cascade** | Account deletion cascades to ALL user data across ALL user-related tables — no orphaned rows left behind | SEC-LOGIC-018 |
| **Export-Deletion Parity** | Account data export scope matches deletion scope — everything that would be deleted is also included in export | SEC-LOGIC-019 |
| **Orphaned Child Records** | Child/junction table rows orphaned when parent record is deleted — missing cascade, trigger, or cleanup job | SEC-LOGIC-020 |

#### 11H: Admin Dashboard Verification (if admin routes detected)

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Multi-Layer Auth** | Every admin page and API route has layered auth: middleware + server-side check + role verification (not just one layer) | SEC-ADMIN-001 |
| **PII Over-Exposure** | Admin APIs return more PII than necessary for the admin task (full email, name, IP in list views) | SEC-ADMIN-002 |
| **No Audit Logging** | Admin actions (user ban, content moderation, config changes) not logged with admin ID, timestamp, and action details | SEC-ADMIN-003 |
| **Inconsistent Rate Limiting** | Rate limiting on some admin routes but missing on others — all admin APIs should be rate-limited | SEC-ADMIN-004 |
| **Cache Staleness Visibility** | Cached dashboard data with no "last updated" indicator — admin sees stale metrics without knowing they're stale | SEC-ADMIN-005 |
| **Hardcoded/Placeholder Metrics** | Dashboard metrics hardcoded to `0` or placeholder values — never wired to real data source | SEC-ADMIN-006 |
| **Return Shape Drift** | DB function/RPC return shape not validated — renamed column silently drops metric to zero with no error | SEC-ADMIN-007 |
| **Missing Error Boundaries** | Admin pages missing error boundaries — single API failure causes white screen instead of graceful degradation | SEC-ADMIN-008 |
| **Client-Side Direct DB Access** | Admin client components query DB directly instead of through admin API routes — bypasses server-side auth/logging | SEC-ADMIN-009 |
| **Legal/Compliance Hold** | Flagged/reported content deletion must be soft-delete only — hard delete violates legal hold requirements | SEC-ADMIN-010 |

**Auto-Fix Templates:**

```typescript
// FIX: Atomic Usage Increment (SEC-LOGIC-003)
// WRONG: check-then-increment (race condition)
const { count } = await db.from('usage').select('count').single()
if (count < limit) {
  await db.from('usage').update({ count: count + 1 })
}

// RIGHT: Atomic increment with limit check in SQL/RPC
const { error } = await db.rpc('increment_usage', {
  p_user_id: userId,
  p_type: usageType,
  p_limit: tierLimit
})
// RPC returns error if limit exceeded — no race window
```

```typescript
// FIX: Webhook Idempotency (SEC-INTEG-008)
// Store webhook event IDs, skip duplicates
const existing = await db
  .from('webhook_events')
  .select('id')
  .eq('event_id', event.id)
  .single()

if (existing.data) {
  return new Response('Already processed', { status: 200 })
}

// Process webhook, then record it
await processWebhook(event)
await db.from('webhook_events').insert({
  event_id: event.id,
  event_type: event.type,
  processed_at: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

```typescript
// FIX: Graceful External Service Degradation (SEC-INTEG-032)
let enrichmentData = null
try {
  enrichmentData = await externalService.enrich(query)
} catch (error) {
  console.warn(`${serviceName} unavailable, proceeding without enrichment:`, error.message)
  // Pipeline continues with null enrichment — degraded but functional
}
```

| **Weak OTP/Code Generation** | Short OTP codes (<6 digits) or non-cryptographic random source | SEC-CRYPTO-008 |
| **Missing CSPRNG** | `crypto.randomBytes()` or `crypto.randomUUID()` not used where needed | SEC-CRYPTO-009 |

#### 12C: Comparison & Timing

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Non-Timing-Safe Comparison** | `===` or `==` used to compare secrets, tokens, API keys, HMAC signatures (should be `timingSafeEqual`) | SEC-CRYPTO-010 |
| **Token Comparison Leak** | Early return on first mismatched byte reveals token length/prefix | SEC-CRYPTO-011 |
| **Webhook Signature Check** | Webhook HMAC verification using string comparison instead of timing-safe | SEC-CRYPTO-012 |

#### 12D: Encryption & Keys

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Hardcoded Encryption Keys** | Encryption keys as string literals in source code | SEC-CRYPTO-013 |

**Auto-Fix:**
- Replace `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomUUID()` or `crypto.randomBytes()`
- Replace `===` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` for secret comparisons
- Upgrade password hashing to bcrypt with cost factor 12+
- Replace hardcoded IVs with `crypto.randomBytes(16)` per-encryption

### Agent 13: Infrastructure & Configuration Security

**Scans deployment configs, CI/CD pipelines, and build settings for security issues.**

**Discovery:** Detect infrastructure files:
```
vercel.json|netlify.toml|fly.toml   # Deployment config
next.config.*|vite.config.*|nuxt.config.*  # Framework config
.github/workflows/*.yml              # CI/CD pipelines
Dockerfile|docker-compose*           # Container config
.env.example|.env.*.example          # Env templates
supabase/config.toml                 # Supabase config
```

#### 13A: Deployment Configuration

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Permissive CORS in Config** | `allowedOrigins: ["*"]` or overly broad origins in deployment config | SEC-INFRA-001 |
| **Missing Security Headers** | Deployment config doesn't set HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP (relying on code only) | SEC-INFRA-002 |
| **Debug Mode in Production** | `NODE_ENV=development` or `debug: true` in production config | SEC-INFRA-003 |
| **Source Maps Enabled** | `productionBrowserSourceMaps: true` in Next.js config or equivalent | SEC-INFRA-004 |
| **Exposed Server Info** | `poweredByHeader: true` (default in Next.js) leaks framework version | SEC-INFRA-005 |
| **Permissive Rewrites/Redirects** | Wildcard rewrites that could proxy to internal services | SEC-INFRA-006 |

#### 13B: CI/CD Pipeline Security

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Secrets in Workflow Files** | Hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials in `.github/workflows/*.yml` | SEC-INFRA-007 |
| **Untrusted Input in Commands** | `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` used in `run:` (command injection via PR title) | SEC-INFRA-008 |
| **Overly Permissive Permissions** | `permissions: write-all` or `contents: write` without justification | SEC-INFRA-009 |
| **Missing Checkout Pin** | `uses: actions/checkout@v4` without SHA pin — vulnerable to supply chain attack | SEC-INFRA-010 |
| **Self-Hosted Runner Risk** | Workflows using `runs-on: self-hosted` without security controls | SEC-INFRA-011 |
| **No Dependency Review** | PRs merge without automated dependency vulnerability checks | SEC-INFRA-012 |

#### 13C: Container & Build Security

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Root Container** | `Dockerfile` runs as root (no `USER` directive) | SEC-INFRA-013 |
| **Secrets Copied to Image** | `COPY .env` or `COPY *.key` in Dockerfile — secrets baked into image | SEC-INFRA-014 |
| **No .dockerignore** | Missing `.dockerignore` — `.env`, `.git`, `node_modules` may be included in image | SEC-INFRA-015 |
| **Latest Tag** | `FROM node:latest` instead of pinned version — unpredictable builds | SEC-INFRA-016 |
| **Build Secrets Exposed** | `ARG` used for secrets (visible in image history) instead of `--mount=type=secret` | SEC-INFRA-017 |

#### 13D: Environment Variable Hygiene

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **NEXT_PUBLIC_ Secrets** | Sensitive values (API keys, DB URLs) exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix | SEC-INFRA-018 |
| **Missing .env.example** | No `.env.example` to document required variables — new devs may misconfigure | SEC-INFRA-019 |
| **Default/Placeholder Secrets** | `.env.example` contains real-looking values that could be used in production | SEC-INFRA-020 |
| **Env Validation Missing** | No runtime validation that required env vars are present (app crashes cryptically) | SEC-INFRA-021 |

**Auto-Fix:**
- Set `poweredByHeader: false` in Next.js config
- Disable `productionBrowserSourceMaps`
- Add SHA pins to GitHub Actions
- Add `USER node` to Dockerfiles
- Create `.dockerignore` excluding `.env`, `.git`, `node_modules`

### Agent 14: Data Flow & Taint Tracking

**Traces user input from entry point through transformations to dangerous sinks. Identifies taint chains where no sanitization exists in the full path.**

**This is the most complex agent.** It doesn't check patterns in isolation — it follows data across files and functions.

**Methodology:**
1. Identify all **sources** (user input entry points)
2. Identify all **sinks** (dangerous operations)
3. Trace the path from each source to each reachable sink
4. Check if sanitization/validation exists at any point in the path
5. Report paths where unsanitized user input reaches a dangerous sink

#### 14A: Source Identification

| Source | Pattern | How Input Enters |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Request body | `req.body`, `request.json()`, `await req.json()` | POST/PUT/PATCH body |
| URL params | `params.id`, `searchParams.get()`, `req.query` | URL path and query |
| Headers | `req.headers.get()`, `headers()` | HTTP headers |
| Cookies | `cookies().get()`, `req.cookies` | Cookie values |
| File uploads | `formData.get('file')`, `req.formData()` | Uploaded content |
| Database reads | `.select()`, `.findMany()`, user-generated content from DB | Stored user data |

#### 14B: Sink Identification

| Sink | Pattern | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| **SQL** | String concatenation in `.from()`, `.rpc()`, raw SQL | SQL Injection |
| **HTML** | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, `document.write()` | XSS |
| **Redirect** | `redirect(userInput)`, `Response.redirect()`, `Location` header | Open Redirect |
| **Shell** | `exec()`, `spawn()`, `execSync()` with user input | Command Injection |
| **File system** | `readFile(userInput)`, `writeFile(userInput)` | Path Traversal |
| **Fetch/HTTP** | `fetch(userInput)`, `axios.get(userInput)` | SSRF |
| **Template** | Template literals with user input in prompts, emails | Template Injection |
| **Eval** | `eval()`, `Function()`, `vm.runInContext()` | Code Execution |
| **Log** | `console.log(userInput)`, `logger.info(userInput)` | Log Injection |

#### 14C: Taint Chain Analysis

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Unsanitized Body → SQL** | Request body reaches raw SQL query without parameterization | SEC-TAINT-001 |
| **Unsanitized Body → HTML** | Request body stored in DB, later rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | SEC-TAINT-002 |
| **URL Param → Redirect** | URL parameter used in redirect without origin validation | SEC-TAINT-003 |
| **URL Param → File Path** | URL parameter used in file system operation without path sanitization | SEC-TAINT-004 |
| **URL Param → Fetch** | URL parameter used in `fetch()` without SSRF protection | SEC-TAINT-005 |
| **Body → Shell Command** | Request body reaches `exec()` or `spawn()` without escaping | SEC-TAINT-006 |
| **Stored Data → HTML** | User-generated content from DB rendered without sanitization | SEC-TAINT-007 |
| **Header → Log** | Request header written to log without CRLF stripping | SEC-TAINT-008 |
| **Cookie → SQL** | Cookie value used in database query without validation | SEC-TAINT-009 |
| **Upload → File System** | Uploaded filename used in file path without sanitization | SEC-TAINT-010 |
| **DB Config → Eval** | Database-stored configuration (model names, prompts) used in dynamic code execution | SEC-TAINT-011 |
| **Multi-Hop Taint** | Input passes through 3+ functions/files before reaching sink — each step looks safe individually | SEC-TAINT-012 |

**Key Instruction:** When tracing, follow the data through:
- Function calls (including async)
- Database storage and retrieval (stored taint)
- Template rendering
- API responses consumed by other endpoints
- Shared utility functions

---

### Agent 15: Security Regression Test Generation

**After vulnerabilities are fixed, generate permanent test files that catch regressions.**

**This agent runs AFTER the fix phase (Stage 4), not during scanning.** For each FIXED finding, create a test that would fail if the vulnerability is reintroduced.

**Discovery:** Detect test framework:
```bash
# Check for test runner
if grep -q "vitest" package.json; then TEST_RUNNER="vitest"
elif grep -q "jest" package.json; then TEST_RUNNER="jest"
elif grep -q "@playwright/test" package.json; then TEST_RUNNER="playwright"
else TEST_RUNNER="vitest"  # Default
fi
```

#### Test Generation Rules

| Finding Category | Test Type | What to Assert |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Unit test | Parameterized query handles `' OR 1=1--` without error |
| **XSS** | Unit test | Output is sanitized (no `<script>` in rendered HTML) |
| **Auth Bypass** | Integration test | Protected route returns 401 without token |
| **IDOR** | Integration test | User A cannot read User B's resource |
| **Rate Limiting** | Integration test | 50 rapid requests → 429 after threshold |
| **RLS** | Database test | Query with User A's token returns only User A's data |
| **Mass Assignment** | Integration test | Extra fields (`is_admin`, `role`) are stripped |
| **SSRF** | Unit test | Private IPs rejected by URL validator |
| **Prompt Injection** | Unit test | System prompt not leaked when asked |
| **Missing Headers** | Integration test | Response includes CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options |
| **Crypto Weakness** | Unit test | Timing-safe comparison used for token verification |
| **Config Exposure** | Build test | Source maps disabled in production build |

**Output:** Write test files to `__tests__/security/` or `tests/security/`:
```
__tests__/security/
├── injection.test.ts       # SQLi, XSSi, Command injection regression
├── auth.test.ts            # Auth bypass, IDOR, privilege escalation
├── api.test.ts             # Rate limiting, mass assignment, CORS
├── crypto.test.ts          # Hashing, timing-safe, random generation
├── headers.test.ts         # Security headers presence
└── ai-security.test.ts     # Prompt injection, output validation
```

**Each test includes a comment linking it to the finding ID:** `// Regression test for SEC-INJ-001`

---

### Agent 16: API Specification Drift Detection

**Compares API documentation/specification against actual implementation to find shadow APIs and undocumented behavior.**

**Discovery:** Check for API specs:
```
openapi.json|openapi.yaml|swagger.json|swagger.yaml
docs/api/*|api-docs/*
README.md (API section)
```

#### 16A: Route Inventory vs Documentation

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Shadow APIs** | Routes that exist in code but not in documentation — undocumented endpoints | SEC-DRIFT-001 |
| **Ghost APIs** | Routes documented but not implemented — misleading docs | SEC-DRIFT-002 |
| **Method Mismatch** | Route supports GET in code but docs say POST only (or vice versa) | SEC-DRIFT-003 |
| **Auth Annotation Mismatch** | Route requires auth in code but docs don't mention it (or vice versa) | SEC-DRIFT-004 |

#### 16B: Parameter & Schema Drift

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Undocumented Parameters** | Route accepts parameters not listed in docs — hidden functionality | SEC-DRIFT-005 |
| **Missing Required Validation** | Docs say parameter is required but code has no validation for it | SEC-DRIFT-006 |
| **Response Schema Mismatch** | Actual response includes fields not in docs (PII leak) or missing documented fields | SEC-DRIFT-007 |
| **Deprecated But Active** | Endpoint marked deprecated in docs but still fully functional with no deprecation warning | SEC-DRIFT-008 |

#### 16C: Version & Compatibility

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Old Version Still Active** | `/api/v1/users` still works alongside `/api/v2/users` — old version may have weaker security | SEC-DRIFT-009 |
| **No Version Strategy** | API has no versioning — breaking changes affect all clients | SEC-DRIFT-010 |

**If no API specification exists:** Inventory all routes, document their methods, parameters, and auth requirements. Flag this as SEC-DRIFT-011 (No API Documentation). Generate a basic route inventory as a starting point.

---

### Agent 17: Build Artifact & Secrets in Output

**Scans build outputs, container images, CI logs, and deployment artifacts for leaked secrets.**

**Discovery:** Check for build artifacts:
```
.next/|dist/|build/|out/            # Build output directories
.github/workflows/*.yml              # CI pipeline logs
Dockerfile|docker-compose*           # Container definitions
.vercel/|.netlify/                   # Deployment cache
```

#### 17A: Build Output Scanning

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Secrets in Client Bundle** | API keys, service role keys, or private tokens in `.next/static/` JS files | SEC-BUILD-001 |
| **Source Maps in Build** | `.map` files present in build output (full source code exposure) | SEC-BUILD-002 |
| **Server Code in Client** | Server-only code or secrets leaked into client chunks via incorrect imports | SEC-BUILD-003 |
| **Debug Info in Build** | `console.log`, `debugger`, or verbose error messages in production build | SEC-BUILD-004 |
| **Environment Snapshot** | `.env` or environment variables captured in build output or build logs | SEC-BUILD-005 |

#### 17B: CI/CD Output Scanning

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Echo Secrets in CI** | `echo $SECRET` or `printenv` in workflow steps — secrets visible in CI logs | SEC-BUILD-006 |
| **Secrets in Artifact Upload** | CI uploads build artifacts that contain `.env` files or secret configs | SEC-BUILD-007 |
| **Cache Poisoning Risk** | CI cache includes sensitive files that could be read by other workflows | SEC-BUILD-008 |
| **No Secret Masking** | CI output doesn't mask secret values — visible in build logs | SEC-BUILD-009 |

#### 17C: Container Image Scanning

| Check | What to Find | Finding ID |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Env in Image** | `.env` files or secret configs baked into Docker image layers | SEC-BUILD-010 |
| **Git History in Image** | `.git/` directory included in container image — full repo history with secrets | SEC-BUILD-011 |
| **Node Modules in Image** | Full `node_modules/` in production image (increases attack surface) | SEC-BUILD-012 |
| **Multi-Stage Leak** | Secrets from build stage leaked into production stage via `COPY --from=builder` | SEC-BUILD-013 |

**Auto-Fix:**
- Add `.map` files to build exclusion
- Audit client bundle imports for server-only code
- Add `COPY .dockerignore` patterns for `.env`, `.git`, `node_modules`
- Replace `echo $SECRET` in CI with masked output
- Use multi-stage Docker builds with minimal final stage

---

## STAGE 2.5: INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION & ADVERSARIAL REVIEW

**Purpose:** Before any finding reaches the report or gets fixed, verify it independently. This stage eliminates false positives and catches cross-cutting issues that individual scanner agents miss.

### 2.5a Independent Verification Agents

For every finding with confidence >= the active gate (8 for daily, 2 for comprehensive):

1. **Spawn a fresh-context verification agent** — this agent has NO knowledge of the original scanner's reasoning
2. Agent receives ONLY: the finding ID, the file:line reference, and the claimed vulnerability type
3. Agent independently reads the code and determines:
   - **VERIFIED** — confirmed the vulnerability exists with independent evidence
   - **UNVERIFIED** — could not confirm; may be mitigated elsewhere
   - **FALSE POSITIVE** — definitively safe; cites specific mitigation code
4. Only VERIFIED findings proceed to the report
5. UNVERIFIED findings are included in Comprehensive mode only (with a caveat)
6. FALSE POSITIVE findings are logged to `.security-reports/exclusions.json` to prevent recurrence

**Agent model:** `sonnet` — must independently reason about exploitability
**Batching:** Verify up to 5 findings per agent, max 2 verification agents in parallel

### 2.5b Adversarial Subagent (Chaos Engineering Thinking)

After all scanner agents complete, spawn ONE adversarial agent that thinks like an attacker:

1. **Input:** Full attack surface map from Stage 1 + list of all verified findings
2. **Mission:** Find what the scanners MISSED by thinking about:
   - Cross-cutting concerns (auth + business logic + AI combining to create an exploit)
   - Multi-step attack chains (finding A + finding B = critical exploit)
   - Resource exhaustion paths (not DoS — financial/operational impact)
   - Trust boundary violations between services
   - Silent data corruption paths
   - Race conditions across async operations
3. **Output:** 0-5 additional findings with confidence scores and exploit scenarios
4. These findings go through the same verification pipeline

**Agent model:** `opus` — requires deep reasoning across multiple code paths
**This agent is NOT optional.** It runs on every audit (daily and comprehensive).

### 2.5c Diff-Mode Shortcut

When `--diff` mode is active, skip independent verification (branch changes are small enough for scanner agents to be high-confidence). Still run the adversarial agent but scope it to changed files only.

---

## STAGE 3: ANALYSIS & PRIORITIZATION

### 3.1 Severity Classification

| Level | Criteria | Auto-Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Exploitable now, data breach risk | Yes, immediately |
| **HIGH** | Significant risk, some conditions needed | Yes, high priority |
| **MEDIUM** | Should fix, harder to exploit | Yes |
| **LOW** | Best practice, minor risk | Yes |

**Each finding also includes:**
- **Confidence:** 1-10 per calibration guide
- **Verification status:** VERIFIED / UNVERIFIED / FALSE POSITIVE
- **Fingerprint:** SHA-256 hash of `finding_id + file_path + line_range + vulnerability_type` — used for cross-run tracking

### 3.2 Fingerprint-Based Trend Tracking

Every finding gets a unique fingerprint. On subsequent runs, fingerprints are compared against `.security-reports/findings.json` to classify each finding:

| Classification | Meaning | Display |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **NEW** | First time seeing this fingerprint | `🆕 NEW` |
| **PERSISTENT** | Same fingerprint from prior run, still unfixed | `⚠️ PERSISTENT (since YYYY-MM-DD)` |
| **RESOLVED** | Fingerprint from prior run no longer detected | `✅ RESOLVED` |
| **REGRESSED** | Fingerprint was RESOLVED in a prior run but reappeared | `🔴 REGRESSED` |

**Trend dashboard in report:**
```
Security Trend (last 3 runs):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Run 1 (2026-03-01): 28 findings → 0 remaining │
│  Run 2 (2026-03-15): 4 new findings → 0 remaining │
│  Run 3 (today):      2 new, 1 regressed → fixing │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Persistent: 0  |  Regressed: 1  |  New: 2      │
│  Trend: STABLE (low new finding rate)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**REGRESSED findings are automatically elevated one severity level** (e.g., MEDIUM → HIGH). A fix that was applied and then reverted is a process problem, not just a code problem.

### 3.3 Build Fix Order

Respect dependencies:
```
RLS enable → RLS policies → Code ownership checks
Auth middleware → Protected routes
Input validation → Database queries
```

---

## STAGE 4: AUTO-FIX LOOP

### 4.1 For Each Finding (Living Report Update Cycle)

Fix in severity order: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW. For each finding:

```
1. Update finding row Status → 🔧 FIXING
2. Update report header Status → 🟡 FIXING — SEC-XXX [description]
3. Write report to disk

4. Check dependencies (are blockers fixed?)
5. Read file and context
6. ATTEMPT 1: Apply fix + add WHY comment
   - Verify: build + quick test
   - If passes → update row → ✅ FIXED, add to Fix Log, add to SITREP "What Was Fixed"
   - If fails → revert

7. ATTEMPT 2: Alternative approach
   - If passes → ✅ FIXED
   - If fails → revert

8. ATTEMPT 3: Different angle
   - If passes → ✅ FIXED
   - If fails → revert, decide:
     a. Needs human decision → ⏸️ DEFERRED
        Add to SITREP "What Was Deferred": reason + what was tried + risk if unfixed
     b. Fix impossible with current approach → 🚫 BLOCKED
        Add to SITREP "What Was Blocked": all 3 attempts + why each failed + what would be needed

9. Append to Progress Log: | [HH:MM] | Stage 4 | SEC-XXX | ✅/⏸️/🚫 |
10. Write report to disk — checkpoint after EVERY status change
11. Move to next finding
```

**The report file is written to disk after EVERY status change.** If the session dies mid-fix, the report shows exactly which findings are done and which remain.

### 4.2 Iterate Until Clean

After all fixes applied:
1. Re-run security scan
2. If new findings → add to task list with `FOUND` status, fix them
3. Repeat until ZERO `FOUND` findings remain
4. Update iteration count in report
5. Append to Progress Log: `| [HH:MM] | Stage 4 | Iteration [N] complete | [X] remaining |`

---

## STAGE 5: VALIDATION

### 5.1 Build & Test
```bash
npm run build  # Must pass
npm test       # Must pass
```

### 5.2 Re-Scan
Verify all findings are actually fixed.

### 5.3 Security Tests
Generate regression tests for critical fixes.

| MEDIUM | 12 | 100% fixed ✅ |
| LOW | 5 | 100% fixed ✅ |
| **TOTAL** | **28** | **100% fixed** ✅ |

### Historical Context

This is security audit #3 for this project:
- Audit #1 (2025-12-01): Score F (28) → D (58)
- Audit #2 (2026-01-15): Score D (58) → B (82)
- **Audit #3 (today):** Score B (82) → A+ (100)

**Trend:** Security posture improving consistently

### Recommendations

1. **Maintain:** Run `/sec-ship` before each release
2. **Monitor:** Set up security monitoring (Sentry security alerts)
3. **Rotate:** Rotate the Stripe key found in git history
4. **Review:** Schedule quarterly security review

### Next Steps

1. Run `/gh-ship` to deploy security fixes
2. Rotate exposed API key (flagged)
3. Enable Vercel security monitoring

## CLEANUP PROTOCOL

> Reference: [Resource Cleanup Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md)

### Sec-Ship-Specific Cleanup

> Reference: [Resource Cleanup Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md) — Ephemeral Artifact Policy

Cleanup actions:
1. **Gitignore enforcement:** Ensure `.security-reports/` is in `.gitignore`
2. **Dependency disclosure:** If security fixes required installing packages (e.g., DOMPurify, helmet), document in SITREP as intentional additions
3. **KEEP permanently:** `findings.json` (fingerprints for trend tracking), `exclusions.json` (false positive memory), `history.json` (audit history), report `.md` files
4. **DELETE old state files:** State files older than 24 hours (no longer useful for resume)
5. **No browser, server, or test data cleanup needed** — this skill modifies code only

## REMEMBER

- **Fix EVERYTHING** — Definition of done is ZERO vulnerabilities
- **Iterate until clean** — Re-scan, fix new findings, repeat
- **Report is the living task list** — Updated after every status change, written to disk constantly
- **Never delete findings** — Only update status: ✅ FIXED / ⏸️ DEFERRED / 🚫 BLOCKED
- **3 attempts before defeat** — Try 3 different approaches, document each, then mark BLOCKED
- **SITREP annotates everything** — What was fixed, what was deferred (WHY), what was blocked (WHY + all attempts)
- **AI security is critical** — Prompt injection is the new SQL injection
- **Test after fixes** — Verify nothing broke
- **Score and track** — Show improvement over time
- **Report survives session restart** — Resume from where it left off via Progress Log
- **Confidence score EVERY finding** — 1-10, calibrated per the guide. No unscored findings.
- **Verify independently** — No finding reaches the report without Stage 2.5 verification
- **Adversarial thinking is mandatory** — The chaos agent runs on EVERY audit, not just comprehensive
- **Fingerprint everything** — Every finding gets a hash for cross-run tracking. Regressions auto-elevate.
- **Respect the gate** — Daily mode = 8/10 confidence minimum. Don't report noise.
- **Exclusions prevent recurrence** — False positives go in exclusions.json, not just discarded
- **This tool has limits** — Always include the disclaimer. Never claim comprehensive coverage.

## RELATED SKILLS

**Feeds from:**
- `/subagent-dev` - new code needs a security audit before shipping
- `/redteam` - active exploitation findings feed into sec-ship for remediation
- `/deps` - vulnerable dependencies are fixed in sec-ship
- `/incident` - security incidents trigger an emergency sec-ship run

**Feeds into:**
- `/gh-ship` - security fixes are committed and shipped via gh-ship
- `/compliance` - confirmed vulnerabilities may require compliance posture updates
- `/compliance-docs` - security findings inform compliance documentation
- `/launch` - sec-ship is a required launch gate

**Pairs with:**
- `/redteam` - static analysis (sec-ship) + active exploitation (redteam) = full security coverage
- `/deps` - dependency vulnerabilities and code security issues are addressed together

**Auto-suggest after completion:**
- `/gh-ship` - "Security fixes staged. Ship? Run /gh-ship."
- `/compliance` - "New vulnerabilities found. Re-evaluate compliance posture? Run /compliance."
